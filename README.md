# Florida-s-hungry

## Description:
This collaborative project was to create a real-world front-end application.  Florida's Hungry was created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  The application utilizes two server-side APIs:  1. Travel-advisor API to gather restaurant data for a specific city, and 2. Open Weather API to gather weather data for the selected city.  Users will select a Florida city to eat from.  Upon selection, a map and weather data will display, along with a populated list of restaurants to try.
